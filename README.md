# VehicleIdentificationNumber

Check 17 character Vehicle identification numbers for correctness by computing the check code.
Fetch information from US Department of Transportation to get details from a VIN. Data can be displayed directly in SwiftUI using the 'details' property.
You may use VehicleIdentificationNumber directly in a SwiftUI TextField and use the isValid property to display a warning icon, or an icon indicating the VIN can
be fetched.
